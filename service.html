            <h3>The Big Event</h3>
            <p>The Big Event is a nonprofit Aggie run organization that gives back to the community of Bryan/College Station every year. They are the largest service event hosted at Texas A&M and I have been a part of it for 3 years now. I have done everything from mulching and weeding, to replacing a porch.</p>

            <h3>Salvation Army</h3>
            <p>I have volunteered for The Salvation Army a few times throughout my college career. I had done it with my student organization AFC throughout the two years I was a part of the organization. I plan to help out more with them in the future along with many other organizations.</p>
