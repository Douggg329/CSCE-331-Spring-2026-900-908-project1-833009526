        <p class = "textbox text port">(WIP) This project invloved utilizing an API database to allow you to figure out recipes that you can make with whatever ingredients you have lying around. This is written in Python and uses a recipes API I found called Spoonacular to find recipes using ingredients I have around that need to be used before going bad. I plan to make a webpage to allow for easier usage.</p>
        <p class = "textbox text port">(Theory) I want to create a cybersecurity system that helps aid against phishing ads within the older community. They are one of the highest targeted groups, and with them not understanding what phishing is creating a stronger sort of spam or junkmail register. Finding small differences within the email or exploring the link prior to them clicking to ensure it's legit.</p>
        <p class = "textbox text port">(WIP) This personal project takes one of my favorite varieties of games, which is roguelikes and combines them with a top down 2-d shooter. This puts you as a character fighting off waves of shapes, the more sides the more powerful. Creating an addictive game with a great game loop, goal is to add more upgrades to create a richer experience. This project works from JavaScript and works in terminal.</p>
